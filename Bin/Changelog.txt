- Danish language file (thanks to Jens Peter Jensen)
- Traditional Chinese language file (thanks to muzuiget)
- Zip and 7z archives can be used as drives now. Additionally D-Fend Reloaded
  can repack the changed files to the zip archive when using a PhysFS folder
  and zip file pair.
- You can make zip packages from installed games (just like the exe installers)
  for long time archiving your games. The zip archive will contain all game
  data (prof file, game files, icon, captured images/sound/videos, additional
  data files). And of course you can import games stored in a zip package to
  D-Fend Reloaded agian. (They can be installed via the File|Import menu or
  even via drag&drop.)
- D-Fend Reloaded has got an online help.
- When uninstalling or transfering game or building installer packages the

  other program files (for example a level editor) which are offered to start
  via the context menu of the profile and the profile menu.

  using notepad.
- Some more speed improvements when working with large profile lists.
- [Fix] The "Run setup" toolbar button was not working.
- [Fix] When using long folder names inside a DOSBox drive D-Fend Reloaded may
  tried to start files in the wrong folder because Windows and DOSBox used

  the vogons forum for the new algorithm.)

- [Fix] When "UseShortFolderNames" was turned off in the DFend.ini the loading

  info dialog.


Version 0.4.0 (05/14/2008)

  database) can be setup by only entering the game name and the filename.
- ScummVM based advantures can be configurated and listed together with the
  DOSBox based profiles now.
- If you define a QBasic interpreter in the setup dialog, you can define bas

  if you want to restore the deleted file.

  Additionally there is a default codepage stored in each language file which
  will be used if the codepage is set to "default" in the profile.
- Now you can (optionally) define a key mapper file for each profile. (If no
  key mapper file is defined, the DOSBox default key mapper file will be used.)
- A list of batch commands which DOSBox will run after the end of the game can
  be defined now (some kind of complement of the Autoexec.bat commands).
- Now you can also make installer packages from your profile templates.
- The templates dialog now has an option to change multiple templates at once
  (like the multi profile editor for normal profile).
- More option to configurate low-level access to mounted CDROMs.

  configuration) in the destination folder before copying the profile data.
- Now you can define if the path to the game and the setup exe file should be
  interpreted absolute (in the physical file system) or relative (to the file
  system in DOSBox).
- Now you can configurate in the setup dialog if D-Fend Reloaded should show
  configuration options in the profile editor which can only be used with
  DOSBox CVS builds (like multiple floppy images per drive, PhysFS support,
  setting the number of text mode lines, VGA chipset and video RAM, Glide
  emulation and printer support).
- When changeing multiple profiles, creating installers etc. now you can select
  and unselect profiles also by any user defined information. (Until now
  selecting was only possible by the predefined fields like language,
  developer, year, etc.)
- Profiles (conf and prof files), screenshots and captured sound can be
  imported by drag&drop now. Dragging program files to the D-Fend Reloaded
  program window will open the new profile wizard with the chosen file.
- Within the multi profile editor you can add, change and delete user-defined
  information fields now.
- For each profile you can define some extra files which will be transfered,
  uninstalled and packed into installer packages together with the other game
  files (like it is already possible with the extra directories).
- The profile editor will show a warning if the user trys to create a new
  profile with no game program filename (and is not using a boot image option).
- When opening the select game exe or select setup exe dialog from the profile
  editor or the wizard the path of the setup exe or the game exe (if already
  defined) will be used as initial directory instead of the games base
  directory.
- When a checksum error (changed or exchanged game program file) is detected,
  D-Fend Reloaded now also offers the option to turn off checksums for the
  profile (until now only keep old checksum or create new checksum).
- The checksum driven game file change detection can be turned off in the setup
  dialog now.

  screenshots of a profile via two new toolbar buttons (or by using the cursor
  keys or the mouse wheel) without closing the dialog. Additionally the zoom
  level is set to 100% when a new image is loaded.  
- The import conf file function now trys to make mount records from the mount
  commands of the autoexec section.
- Now you can setup which icons should be visible on the toolbar.

  the profile in memory before closing D-Fend Reloaded.
